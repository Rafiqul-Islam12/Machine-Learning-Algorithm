### ***Naive Bayes is a machine learning algorithm that `uses probability` to classify data. It’s `based on Bayes’ Theorem`, a formula for calculating conditional probabilities.***  

***“Naive Bayes = Bayes theorem + Feature Independence”***  
***সব feature একে অপরের থেকে independent.***

***where A and B are events and P(B) ≠ 0.***
- ***P(A|B) is a conditional probability: the probability of event A occurring given that B is true. It is also called the posterior probability of A given B.***
- ***P(B|A) is also a conditional probability: the probability of event B occurring given that A is true. It can also be interpreted as the likelihood of A given a fixed B.***
- ***P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of observing A and B respectively without any given conditions; they are known as the prior probability and marginal probability.***
